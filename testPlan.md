# Test plan

## 1.   Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration.
It describes the approach to testing the software.
This Test Plan for vnv supports the following objectives:

- Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.
- Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
- Outlines the testing approach that will be used.
- Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2 Scope

This document describes the used tests, as they are unittests and functionality testing.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is meant for internal use primarily.

### 1.4 Document Terminology and Acronyms

- **SRS** Software Requirements Specification
- **n/a** not applicable
- **tbd** to be determined

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

### 2.1 Background

By testing our project, we make sure that all changes to the sourcecode do not break the functionality. Also by integrating the test process in our deployment process, we make sure that only working versions of our project getting deployed. So the web application is always available.

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission

Our motivation in implementing tests came at an early stage to recognize the need for errors and to ensure the functionality and thus the outstanding quality of the software.

### 2.3 Test Motivators

Our motivation in implementing tests came at an early stage to recognize the need for errors and to ensure the functionality and thus the outstanding quality of the software.
Our testing is motivated by

- quality risks
- technical risks,
- use cases
- functional requirements

## 3. Target Test Items

The listing below identifies those test items (software, hardware, and supporting product elements) that have been identified as targets for testing. This list represents what items will be tested.
Items for Testing:

- java backend
- UI (Android-App)
- local installation

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests

### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions

Unit testing of the java backend and functional testing of the user-interface as well as a installation test from a user.

### 4.2 Outline of Other Candidates for Potential Inclusion

Integration testing of key elements that work on a wider scope are potential test scenarios as well but these are not in scope if our current testing process.

#### 7.6.3 Test Guidelines

- One test-class contains test for only one class that needs to be tested
- The test-class should have the same name as the class to be tested with the Addition "Test" at the end (ex. MyClass -> MyClassTest)
- The test-functions should be named so one can see its purpose without the need of looking into the implementation. It should contain the name of the tested function, the testcase and the expected outcome. (ex. "setSpeed_canNotBeNegative_speedShouldBeUnchanged()").
